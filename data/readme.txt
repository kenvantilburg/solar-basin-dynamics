The files in constraints/ are the experimental constraints
used in code/Summary/constraints.ipynb.

The files in diffusion/ are tabulated values of the 
diffusivity and the probability for a particle to scatter 
between two values of semimajor axis in some time window 
dt in some semimajor axis range d(âˆ†a).  These expressions 
are implicitly defined in the companion paper, in Eqs. 5.6 
and 5.12.

Earth_hits/ contains data for earth hits from forward 
simulations.  To use this data in 
code/Summary/constraints.ipynb, unzip all files in 
Earth_hits and merge them into one file with
"copy hit_record_* hit_record.csv".

The files in paperplots/ are used in the Mathematica
notebook code/PaperPlots.nb--see that file for the usage
of each data file.

hist.npy is an output of code/secular_pt.ipynb: a 3D 
(histogram) array (x,y,z) of the time-averaged solar basin 
density.

Q_DP_solar.csv is the energy loss rate Q for dark photons in 
the sun.  It is tabualated in code/Summary/constraints.ipynb.

struct_b16_agss09.dat contains information about the solar
model used in code/Summary/constraints.ipynb.
