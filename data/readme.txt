The files in constraints/ are the experimental constraints
used in code/Summary/constraints.ipynb.

The files in diffusion/ are tabulated values of the 
diffusivity and the probability for a particle to scatter 
between two values of semimajor axis in some time window 
dt in some semimajor axis range d(âˆ†a).  These expressions 
are implicitly defined in the companion paper, in Eqs. 5.6 
and 5.12.

Q_DP_solar.csv is the energy loss rate Q for dark photons in 
the sun.  It is tabualated in code/Summary/constraints.ipynb.

struct_b16_agss09.dat contains information about the solar
model used in code/Summary/constraints.ipynb.
