constraints.ipynb contains the python code used to generate 
summary figures.  Details about the solar model are tabulated
in data/struct_b16_agss09.dat.  Experimental data for these 
plots is located in data/constraints.  constraints.ipynb also
tabulates data/Q_DP_solar.csv (energy loss rate for dark 
photons in the sun) and reads it in on subsequent evaluations 
to save time.  The other two files contain auxiliary 
functions and plot options.
