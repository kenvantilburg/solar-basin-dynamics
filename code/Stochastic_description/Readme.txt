diffusion.nb is a Mathematica notebook for solving the Fokker
Planck equation.  The data files are tabulated values of
the diffusivity and the probability for a particle to scatter 
between two values of semimajor axis in some time window dt 
in some semimajor axis range d(âˆ†a).  These expressions are 
implicitly defined in the companion paper, in Eqs. 5.6 and 5.12
